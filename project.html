                <div><h1>Description</h1></div>
                <p> The purpose of the project was to gain experience with HTML, Javascript, and CSS. I created an iPod 
                    that was interactive to the user. The visuals were created from scratch using HTML and CSS to style,
                    and many buttons on the virtual iPod were interactive. An interesting feature to note is that the 
                    time bar on the player moves in real-time if a song is being played. Other skills learned through the
                    assignment include inserting images into HTML pages, linking pages, use of Javascript functions, 
                    and inserting styled buttons into pages. 
                </p>
                <p>The project was done during the class EECS 330 : Human Computer Interaction.</p>
